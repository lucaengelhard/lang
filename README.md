# Todo

- Rewrite with better information passing
- Arrays
- Array access
- std functions (casting, sorting maybe?)
- change print to be a closer binding and give more control to the language
- Rewrite so more (typed) information is passed
- Typechecking rebuilds the whole ast and updates type fields -> Type ops
  similar to interpreter ops
